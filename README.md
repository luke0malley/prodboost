# Known issues

## Discrepencies between dev ('npm start') and production mode ('npm run build')

- In production, after adding a URL to the blocked list, the URL is cleared from the text box. In dev mode, this does not happen.
- In production, when a blocking session starts, a countdown is visible. In dev, countdown is initiated, but does not seem to continue.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Testing with Playwright

tldr:
Tests are in the tests directory. To run them (in development)
1. start the program in development mode with `npm start`
2. make sure you are in the tests/ folder
3. run `npx playwright test` to run all tests in tests/, OR
    - to run individual tests, find the filename containing your test and the line number on which the test begins.
    - use the command format: `npx playwright test {filename}:{line_num} --project=chromium`
    - for example, if a line exists on line 240 in BlockedURLs.spec.js, you would run `npx playwright test BlockedURLs.spec.js:240 --project=chromium`
    - NOTE: for some reason, sometimes running multiple tests results in a timeout error, even though the tests run individually without issue

Tests are located in the tests/ directory.
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npx playwright test
    Runs the end-to-end tests.

  npx playwright test --ui
    Starts the interactive UI mode.

  npx playwright test --project=chromium
    Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

  npx playwright test example
    Runs the tests in a specific file.

  npx playwright test --debug
    Runs the tests in debug mode.

  npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    npx playwright test

And check out the following files:
  - .\tests\example.spec.js - Example end-to-end test
  - .\tests-examples\demo-todo-app.spec.js - Demo Todo App end-to-end tests
  - .\playwright.config.js - Playwright Test configuration
